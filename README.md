# Gamepad SDK

A simple SDK for handling gamepad input in the browser using the `navigator.Gamepad` API. This SDK provides an easy way to detect button presses, releases, axis movements, and gamepad connection/disconnection events.

## Features

- Detect gamepad button presses and releases.
- Track axis changes (analog stick movements).
- Listen for gamepad connection and disconnection events.
- Works with multiple gamepads.

## Installation

You can install the SDK via NPM:

```bash
npm install gamepad-sdk
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the Gamepad SDK in your project:

```javascript
const GamepadSDK = require('gamepad-sdk');

// Initialize the SDK
const myGamepad = new GamepadSDK();

// Listen for button presses
myGamepad.addEventListener('buttonpress', (event) => {
  console.log(`Button ${event.buttonIndex} was pressed on gamepad: ${event.gamepad.id}`);
});

// Listen for axis changes
myGamepad.addEventListener('axischange', (event) => {
  console.log(`Axis ${event.axisIndex} changed to ${event.axisValue} on gamepad: ${event.gamepad.id}`);
});

// Listen for gamepad connection
myGamepad.addEventListener('connect', (event) => {
  console.log(`Gamepad connected: ${event.gamepad.id}`);
});

// Listen for gamepad disconnection
myGamepad.addEventListener('disconnect', (event) => {
  console.log(`Gamepad disconnected: ${event.gamepad.id}`);
});
```

## Event Types

### `buttonpress`
Triggered when a button is pressed.

#### Event Object:
- `gamepad`: The gamepad object.
- `button`: The button object.
- `buttonIndex`: The index of the pressed button.

### `buttonrelease`
Triggered when a button is released.

#### Event Object:
- `gamepad`: The gamepad object.
- `button`: The button object.
- `buttonIndex`: The index of the released button.

### `axischange`
Triggered when a gamepad axis (such as an analog stick) changes position.

#### Event Object:
- `gamepad`: The gamepad object.
- `axisValue`: The value of the axis (ranging from -1.0 to 1.0).
- `axisIndex`: The index of the axis that changed.

### `connect`
Triggered when a gamepad is connected.

#### Event Object:
- `gamepad`: The connected gamepad object.

### `disconnect`
Triggered when a gamepad is disconnected.

#### Event Object:
- `gamepad`: The disconnected gamepad object.

## Browser Compatibility

The Gamepad API is still an experimental feature in some browsers. Ensure that you check browser compatibility before using this SDK in production.

### Supported Browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Opera
